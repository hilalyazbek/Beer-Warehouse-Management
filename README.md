# Iterates
Dotnet api built using dotnet core and entity framework.

### Solution Architecture and Design Pattern
This solution uses a variation of a Domain Driven Design and Repository / Service pattern

### Repository / Service pattern
Similar to the Repository and Unit of Work pattern, I like to use a service class instead of the Unit of work class.
The service class handles the business logic and communicates with the Repository
